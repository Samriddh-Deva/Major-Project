Explainable AI (XAI) via Gradient Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM): To gain insights into the decision-making process of the CNN, Explainable AI is implemented using Grad-CAM. This technique highlights regions of the image that significantly contribute to the model's classification. Interestingly, the model focuses on small visual imperfections in the background rather than the main entity, revealing interpretability aspects.
